** session based authentication **
* used express-session to save the user session
* and that session is saved into mongo store
* a cookie will be stored on ui side with connect.sid cookie-name and same session-id will be stored in mongoStore.

** worker threads **
* new thread will be created with file
* unlike cluster and child_process worker threads can share data between mainThread and workerThread and among workerThread as well
* not all workerData is transferrable so need to mention such type of data in transferList
* can create MessageChannel to communicate between worker threads without affecting main thread
